# 🚴‍♂️ Crisis Recovery Insights – Online Food Delivery Startup
## Codebasics Resume Project Challenge

A phase-wise analysis (Pre-Crisis → Crisis → Recovery) of an online food delivery startup to identify business challenges, performance drop patterns, and data-driven recovery strategies. This project includes a fully interactive Power BI dashboard supported by Python-based data preprocessing and Excel cleaning workflows.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding how a food-tech startup's operations were impacted across three critical phases. By analyzing orders, customer engagement, delivery performance, restaurant dependencies, and customer sentiment, the goal was to uncover the root causes of decline and recommend actions to accelerate recovery.

## 📊 Key Insights

* Customer engagement dropped sharply after May — active users & orders fell ~60%.
* Top restaurants contributed a major share of revenue — indicating high dependency risk.
* On-time delivery rates collapsed during crisis; full-time partners performed better during recovery.
* Customer ratings fell from ~4.6 to ~2.3, mainly due to delays and service issues.
